# Yahoo Finance API with AngularJS 


## App Specifics

The App uses the [Yahoo Query Language (YQL)](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql) with the Yahoo Finance REST API to retrieve financial data for a selected stock ticker symbol. 

In the public directory I have included "yahoo-data.json" which is the complete JSON file returned by the Yahoo Finance API for a given ticker symbol query. You can search through the JSON file to view the full list of information that is available for a specific stock.


## Running the App

- clone the repository
- bower install
- select 'index.html'
- Enter a valid stock ticker symbol
